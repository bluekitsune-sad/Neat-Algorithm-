# NEAT Algorithm - Flappy Bird AI Game

## Overview
This project leverages the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to develop an AI agent capable of playing the Flappy Bird game autonomously. The AI agent evolves through generations, learning to improve its gameplay by optimizing neural network topologies and weights.

## Features
- **AI Gameplay:** The AI agent autonomously plays Flappy Bird, adapting to varying game environments and improving over time.
- **NeuroEvolution:** Utilizes the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural network controllers, allowing dynamic adaptation and learning.
- **Custom Game Environment:** A Python-based Flappy Bird environment for training and evaluating the AI agent.

## How It Works
1. **Initialization:** The NEAT algorithm initializes a population of simple neural networks.
2. **Training:** Each network is evaluated based on its performance in the game (e.g., score achieved).
3. **Evolution:** Networks evolve over generations through selection, mutation, and crossover, optimizing for better performance.
4. **Deployment:** The best-performing network is used as the AI agent for playing the game.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neat-flappy-bird.git
   cd neat-flappy-bird
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird_neat.py
   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NEAT-Python
- pygame

## File Structure
- `flappy_bird_neat.py`: Main script to run the game and train the AI.
- `neat-config.txt`: Configuration file for the NEAT algorithm.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Configuration
The NEAT configuration file (`neat-config.txt`) allows customization of the algorithm's parameters, such as population size, mutation rates, and fitness thresholds. Adjust these parameters to optimize training performance.

## Results
As the training progresses, the AI agent improves its gameplay, achieving higher scores by learning to navigate the obstacles effectively. The evolution of the neural networks is visualized, showing the progression of learning over generations.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further optimize NEAT parameters for faster convergence.
- **Visualization:** Enhance visual representation of neural networks and training progress.
- **Game Variants:** Extend the AI to play variations of Flappy Bird with different challenges.
